## About

![logo](https://raw.github.com/towerjoo/cocos2dx_startpoint/master/logo.png)

This project is to ease the start of a new [cocos2d-x][cocos2dx] based project which is called *start point* in this project.

And it should:

1. easy to start from
2. easy to customize
3. add some useful toolkits

## Features

Now the current project supports:

1. some managers to ease the start(UserManager, LocalStorageManager, CommunicationManager)
2. JSON Library include
3. Box-2D include
4. a *reasonable* directories layout, at least for me.

## Usage

To use this tool, you can:

1. clone or download the source code
2. *cd* to the root directory of the source code, and run the *rename.py* to change the project name to what you want.
   *python rename.py -h* will show you the usage of that script

## Change Log

1. 2012-09-18  Make the basic workable codebase
